Wells Fargo Software Engineering Work Simulation Project
This repository contains my two tasks from the Wells Fargo Software Engineering Virtual Work Simulation Project on the Forage online application. In this project, I assumed the role and responsibilities of a project analyst, with a primary focus on designing a data model to enhance the efficiency of financial advisors in managing their clients' portfolios. The two main tasks were:

Data Model and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Design: I drafted a comprehensive ERD that meets the project requirements and aids the development team in creating a well-structured system. This task emphasized the importance of ERDs in designing relational databases.

Implementing the Data Model with Java: I translated the data model into Java classes within Visual Studio Code. I created classes for each entity, annotated them with @Entity, ensured the auto-generation of primary keys, added constructors to initialize instance variables, and provided getter and setter methods for the attributes.
